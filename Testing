She looked down at her notes. “What?” she said, confused. Again, I pointed deliberately to her notes. On her pad she had written: “Robert Kiyosaki, best-selling author .” “It says best-selling author , not best-writing author ,” I said quietly . Her eyes widened. “I am a terrible writer ,” I said. “Y ou are a great writer . I went to sales school. Y ou have a master ’ s degree. Put them together and you get a ‘best- selling author ’ and a ‘best-writing author .’” Anger flared from her eyes. “I’ll never stoop so low as to learn how to sell. People like you have no business writing. I am a professionally trained writer and you are a salesman. It is not fair ,” she fumed. She put the rest of her notes away and hurried out through the lar ge glass doors into the humid Singapore morning.

My book, Rich Dad Poor Dad , was on the New Y ork T imes best-sellers list for over seven years and is one of the top three best- selling books in the United States. The only books ahead of it are The Joy of Sex and The Road Less T raveled . Adding one more irony , Rich Dad Poor Dad and my CASHFLOW ® board game are a book and a game about accounting, another subject I struggled with. So what does this have to do with the question: “What is your goal in life?” The answer is found in the simple, yet profound, statement by a V ietnamese monk, Thich Naht Hahn: “The path is the goal.” In other words, finding your path in life is your goal in life. Y our path is not your A c k n o w l e d g m e n t s How does a person say “thank you” when there are so many people to thank? Obviously this book is a thank you to my two fathers, who were powerful ro le models, and to my mom, who taught me love and kindness.
